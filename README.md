# Mail.Sender
## Mail.Sender by AIU COM20 (A) student for CS 102:JAVA midterm examination. 
This app can send email to anyone you want, all you need to do is sign in using your @gmail account.

After you signed in and wrote a message, you obviously need to send it..

If you have a problem with sending an email and you are not able to see a notification that says "Message Sent!" you need to allow less secure apps work with your gmail.. 
You need to follow this link https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/challenge/pwd?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Flesssecureapps&service=accountsettings&osid=1&rart=ANgoxcdj2J6AvuZLd4rUPyB8FXi-4fs2BnhcBzJJoeUOm7Ti9cnSHa5DNMfzY1vfK-KogK0P8vKyieAgXYy_9WTL850Itrc2mQ&TL=AM3QAYZtIv9uwz8UyNjzrf1QKaG04OAdPWe6NlpRMm_czYYJCxHKJe4n4Bd6FMfc&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&cid=1&flowEntry=ServiceLogin, sign in and allow less secure apps in your account. It should look like this..

As you could see in previous screenshots I used my own gmail to send a message to my another email adress, so I could show you that my app is working properly and without any issues. There is what I've got..

### In this project I've used several libriares which you could find in this repo in folder called LIBRARIES

### I've used a bit of CSS styles, as you required, which you could see in Sample.fxml file, which is also in this repo

### It also has a small piece of ABOUT INFO, which you're able to see in next screenshot..
